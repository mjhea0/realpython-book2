Basic Workflow for Django Project and Application

Creating a Project:

python django-admin.py startproject <name_of_the_project>

(this create the Project in a new directory)

Creating an App:
1. python manage.py startapp <name_of_the_app>
2. Add the name of the app to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
(so django knows that the app exists)
3. link app url to main urls within Projects urls.py file
4. Add views to the app views.py file
5. add urls.py file in app dir to map views to specific urls
6. Create template dir, update paths in settings.py and add templates
